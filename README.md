## Pregnancy Weeks Information

This gem will allow a user to interact through a CLI. The CLI will prompt a user to look into the various weeks of the three trimesters of a 9-month pregnancy to stay informed. You will find out how big your baby is in weight (both US and metric), what fruit size best compares to the size of the baby in any given week, as well as how many more weeks to go before baby's arrival. You will also be able to look further into each of the 1-42 weeks of pregnancy for specific symptoms, and get a list of further readings that would be meaningful to research for that week.
